# Web Scraping Moroccan Micro Census Data
The Federal Statistics Office in Morocco conducts a census every 10 years. Some of the data is prepared in Excel files while other data is only available on the website. The following presents code and instructions how to webscrape specific data for every municipality and store the results in a .csv file.

The code is written to scrape for the [RGPH 2004](https://applications-web.hcp.ma/hpmc/frmmarocenchiffres.aspx)
